    <h2>Object Detection System Overview</h2>

    <p>
        I built an <span class="highlight">object detection system</span> using the 
        <span class="highlight">Pascal VOC 2012 dataset</span> from Kaggle. The model was trained using 
        <span class="highlight">YOLOv5</span> with Kaggle's GPU acceleration to enhance performance and reduce training time.
    </p>

    <p>
        After training, the model weights were exported from the <code>.pt</code> format to the more portable 
        <span class="highlight">ONNX format</span> to ensure broader compatibility across platforms and inference engines.
    </p>

    <p>
        The trained model and outputs were downloaded locally, where 
        <span class="highlight">OpenCV</span> was used for real-time predictions on 
        <span class="highlight">images, videos, and live webcam input</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        For accessibility and user interaction, the detection system was integrated into a 
        <span class="highlight">Streamlit web interface</span> 
        <span class="highlight">, allowing image uploads and real-time detection directly on mobile devices.
    </p>
